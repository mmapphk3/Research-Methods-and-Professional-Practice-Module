<p>Fig1: Agent 1 vs Agent 2</p>


The one-tailed paired t-test result for determining whether Filter Agent 1 (Con1) is more effective than Filter Agent 2 (Con2) yields a t-statistic of approximately 2.87 and a p-value of 0.0092. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Filter Agent 1 is statistically more effective than Filter Agent 2 at the 5% significance level.

#### Exercise 7.2

<p>Fig2: Male Income vs Female Income </p>

The obtained independent samples t-statistic is 3.27 with 118 degrees of freedom. The associated one-tailed p-value is  p = 0.0007, indicating that the observed t-value is significant at the 1% level (one-tailed). The sample mean income for males was found to be 52.91, while the mean income for females was 44.23. Therefore, the data provide strong evidence that the underlying mean income for males is significantly higher than that of females by an estimated difference of 52.91 - 44.23 = 8.68.

These results strongly suggest that males, on average, earn more than females in the population. Given that the observed difference in mean incomes is statistically significant, we can conclude with confidence that the population mean income for males exceeds that of females.
This analysis assumes that the data meet the assumptions of normality and equal variances, which underpin the validity of the t-test. To ensure robustness, it is recommended to check these assumptions using normality tests (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk) and tests for equal variances (e.g., Leveneâ€™s test). If any assumptions are violated, alternative statistical methods such as the Mann-Whitney U test should be considered.

### Summary Measures Worksheet

#### Exercise 6.1

<p>Fig3: Diet A vs Diet B </p>

The summary statistics for the two diets show that Diet A has a mean weight loss of 5.341 kg with a standard deviation of 2.536, while Diet B has a mean weight loss of 3.710 kg with a standard deviation of 2.603.

These results indicate that, on average, Diet A leads to greater weight loss compared to Diet B. Specifically, participants on Diet A lost about 1.631 kg more than those on Diet B. Both diets show some variability in outcomes, but the difference in mean weight loss suggests that Diet A is more effective in helping participants reduce weight compared to Diet B.

#### Exercise 6.2

<img src="https://github.com/mmapphk3/Research-Methods-and-Professional-Practice/blob/d4a983eee3ded4851595f76981784c8f9f462a76/ex6.2.png" alt="Corr Plot 1" style="width: 50%;"> 
<p>Fig4: Diet A vs Diet B Part 2 </p>

The median weight loss for Diet A is 5.642 kg, while for Diet B it is 3.745 kg, indicating that participants on Diet A generally lost more weight. The interquartile range (IQR) for Diet A is 3.285, compared to 3.4505 for Diet B, showing that the variability in weight loss is similar between the two diets.

Looking at the quartiles, the lower quartile (Q1) for Diet A is 3.748 kg, meaning that 25% of participants lost less than this amount, while for Diet B the lower quartile is 1.953 kg, suggesting that participants on Diet B had lower initial weight loss results. The upper quartile (Q3) for Diet A is 7.033 kg, compared to 5.4035 kg for Diet B, indicating that the top 25% of participants on Diet A achieved significantly greater weight loss than those on Diet B.

Overall, these quartiles and the median suggest that Diet A is more effective in producing higher weight loss, especially for participants in the upper range, while Diet B shows lower results in comparison.

### Exercise 6.3

<p>Fig5: Area 1 vs Area 2 </p>

The frequency and percentage distributions provide insights into the patterns of brand preferences between Area 1 and Area 2. In Area 1, 15.7% of people prefer Brand A, 24.3% choose Brand B, and the majority, 60%, opt for "Other" brands. This indicates that while Brand B is more popular than Brand A in Area 1, a significant portion of the population prefers brands outside of A and B.

In contrast, in Area 2, preferences shift slightly. Brand A is preferred by 21.1% of people, which is higher than in Area 1, and Brand B is chosen by 33.3% of the population, also a higher percentage than in Area 1. The proportion of people choosing "Other" brands in Area 2 is lower at 45.6%.
Overall, these results suggest that Brand B is the most popular in both areas but more so in Area 2. Additionally, Area 2 has a higher preference for both Brand A and Brand B compared to Area 1, where a larger proportion of the population leans towards "Other" brands. This indicates a stronger brand loyalty to A and B in Area 2, while Area 1 shows more diversity in brand preferences.

#### Exercise 9.1

<p>Fig6: Bar Chart: Area 1 vs Area 2 </p>

The bar chart for Area 2 shows that the majority of people, 45.6%, prefer "Other" brands, followed by 33.3% who choose Brand B, and 21.1% who select Brand A. This indicates that while Brand B is relatively popular, more people in Area 2 opt for alternative brands outside of A and B. Brand A has the lowest preference, making it the least favored option among the three categories in this area.

#### Exercise 9.2

<p>Fig7: Clustered Bar Chart </p>

The clustered bar chart shows the prevalence of heather species in two locations, Location A and Location B, across three categories: Absent, Sparse, and Abundant. In the Absent category, Location B has a significantly higher prevalence, with around 45% of observations, compared to less than 20% in Location A. For the Sparse category, Location A shows a higher prevalence, with about 40%, while Location B has approximately 30%. Finally, in the Abundant category, Location A dominates, with nearly 50% of observations, compared to just 20% in Location B. Overall, the chart indicates that heather species are more prevalent and abundant in Location A than in Location B.

#### Exercise 9.3

<p>Fig8: Diet A & B: Histrogram </p>

The relative frequency histograms for Diet A and Diet B provide insights into the distribution of weight loss for individuals following each diet.
For Diet A, the histogram shows a unimodal and relatively symmetric distribution, with the majority of individuals losing between 3 kg and 7 kg. The peak is around 5 kg, and the distribution tapers off on both sides, with fewer individuals experiencing extreme weight loss or weight gain. There is perhaps a slight hint of negative skewness, indicating that a few participants experienced higher-than-average weight loss.

For Diet B, the histogram appears more spread out, with a wider range of weight loss outcomes, including some individuals who gained weight (negative weight loss) and a few who lost significant amounts (up to 10 kg). The distribution is slightly right-skewed, with a peak around 3-4 kg and a more gradual tapering off toward higher weight losses. This indicates that while some participants on Diet B experienced substantial weight loss, the majority lost around 3-4 kg.

Comparing the two diets, Diet A shows a more concentrated and symmetric pattern of weight loss, with most participants achieving moderate to significant weight loss. In contrast, Diet B results in more variability, with a wider spread of outcomes, suggesting that the effectiveness of Diet B may be more inconsistent across individuals.
