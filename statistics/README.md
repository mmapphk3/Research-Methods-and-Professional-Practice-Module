<p>Fig1: Agent 1 vs Agent 2</p>


A one-tailed paired t-test found a t-statistic of 2.87 and a p-value of 0.0092, leading to the conclusion that Filter Agent 1 is statistically more effective than Filter Agent 2 at the 5% level.

#### Exercise 7.2

<p>Fig2: Male Income vs Female Income</p>

An independent samples t-test found a t-statistic of 3.27 (df = 118) and a one-tailed p-value of 0.0007, indicating significance at the 1% level. The mean income for males was $52.91, compared to $44.23 for females, with a significant difference of $8.68. This provides strong evidence that males earn more than females. Assumptions of normality and equal variances should be checked; if violated, consider the Mann-Whitney U test.

### Summary Measures Worksheet

#### Exercise 6.1

<p>Fig3: Diet A vs Diet B</p>

The summary statistics show that Diet A had a mean weight loss of 5.341 kg (SD = 2.536), while Diet B had a mean weight loss of 3.710 kg (SD = 2.603), with Diet A leading to 1.631 kg more weight loss on average. This suggests Diet A is more effective for weight loss compared to Diet B, despite some variability in both diets' outcomes.

#### Exercise 6.2

<p>Fig4: Diet A vs Diet B p2</p>

The median weight loss for Diet A is 5.642 kg, while for Diet B it is 3.745 kg, showing that Diet A generally leads to more weight loss. Both diets have similar variability, with an IQR of 3.285 for Diet A and 3.4505 for Diet B. The lower quartile for Diet A is 3.748 kg compared to 1.953 kg for Diet B, indicating that Diet A had higher initial results. The upper quartile for Diet A is 7.033 kg, significantly higher than Diet B's 5.4035 kg, suggesting that participants on Diet A, particularly in the upper range, experienced greater weight loss.

### Exercise 6.3

<p>Fig5: Percentage Distribution</p>

In Area 1, 15.7% prefer Brand A, 24.3% prefer Brand B, and 60% choose "Other" brands, indicating Brand B's slight popularity but a strong preference for other brands. In Area 2, 21.1% prefer Brand A, and 33.3% prefer Brand B, with a lower 45.6% opting for "Other" brands. Brand B is the most popular in both areas, particularly in Area 2, where there is a higher preference for both Brand A and B, suggesting stronger brand loyalty compared to Area 1, where preferences are more diverse.

### Chart worksheet

#### Exercise 9.1

<p>Fig6: Bar Chart</p>

The bar chart for Area 2 shows that 45.6% prefer "Other" brands, 33.3% prefer Brand B, and 21.1% prefer Brand A. This suggests that while Brand B is relatively popular, most people in Area 2 choose brands outside of A and B, with Brand A being the least favored option.
#### Exercise 9.2

<p>Fig7: Clustered Bar Chart</p>

The clustered bar chart shows that in the Absent category, Location B has a higher prevalence (45%) than Location A (under 20%). In the Sparse category, Location A leads with 40%, while Location B has 30%. In the Abundant category, Location A dominates with nearly 50%, compared to 20% in Location B. Overall, heather species are more prevalent and abundant in Location A than in Location B.

#### Exercise 9.3

<p>Fig8: Histogram </p>

The relative frequency histograms show that Diet A has a unimodal, symmetric distribution, with most participants losing 3-7 kg, peaking around 5 kg, and tapering off at the extremes. Diet B's distribution is more spread out and right-skewed, with a peak around 3-4 kg and a wider range of weight loss outcomes, including some weight gain. Comparing the two, Diet A shows more consistent weight loss, while Diet B has greater variability, indicating less consistent effectiveness across participants.
