### Reflective Piece

#### Module: Research Methods and Professional Practice

The Research Methods and Professional Practice module has provided me with a well-rounded foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of research, especially in the context of ethics and emerging technologies like generative AI. Through various reflective activities, collaborative discussions, statistical exercises, and a research proposal, I have developed skills that will significantly benefit my professional career as a data analyst.

#### Statistical Analysis Skills

One of the key skills I’ve developed during this module is my ability to conduct statistical analysis confidently. The statistical exercises, which included hypothesis testing, summary measures, and chart plotting, required precision and a solid understanding of analytical techniques. By utilizing Excel, I was able to explore various statistical formulas that are essential when conducting research.
These exercises were particularly rewarding because they reinforced my mathematical abilities, which I have always considered one of my strengths. Successfully completing these tasks boosted my confidence, and I found enjoyment in demonstrating my analytical skills. This newfound confidence in statistical methods is something I can immediately apply to my work as a data analyst. For instance, I can now more confidently perform data analysis in Excel or other statistical tools, ensuring that my insights are backed by solid evidence.

#### Research Methods Process

The module also expanded my understanding of the research methods process, especially through the various reflective activities and the literature review for my research proposal. One of the standout moments was conducting a literature review on Netflix’s use of deep learning for recommender systems. This required a deep dive into complex topics such as collaborative filtering and deep learning models, and how they contribute to personalised content suggestions. The review challenged me to not only understand the research methods used in the study but also critically evaluate their effectiveness.

For example, I learned to question how test results might not always translate to real-world success, as highlighted by Steck et al. (2021). This critical thinking mindset, developed through reviewing various studies, has sharpened my ability to assess research outcomes, something that will be valuable in any future research or data-driven projects I work on.

I also gained practical experience in developing my research proposal on Spotify's use of clustering techniques for personalising music recommendations. This required me to design a structured research plan, considering both theoretical and practical aspects of clustering algorithms. Through this process, I strengthened my skills in research design, learned how to gather relevant data ethically, and incorporated statistical tests like k-means clustering to improve recommendation accuracy. This experience has broadened my understanding of machine learning models and how they can be applied to real-world problems, further preparing me for complex research tasks in the future.

#### Critical Reflection on Professional Practice

The collaborative discussions on ethical issues, especially regarding AI governance and the misuse of personal data, played a pivotal role in shaping my perspective on how ethical considerations are intertwined with professional practice. I found the discussion on AI governance particularly engaging, as it opened my eyes to the global challenges posed by rapid technological advancements. Reflecting on the governance models proposed by Correa et al. (2023) and Deckard (2023), I realised the importance of adopting flexible yet structured approaches to global AI regulation. This has encouraged me to think more critically about the ethical dimensions of my work as a data analyst, especially when dealing with sensitive data.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal provided another key moment for reflection. The case highlighted the dangers of inappropriate use of data, particularly through surveys that collect personal information under false pretenses. This taught me valuable lessons about transparency, consent, and data privacy. Reflecting on these ethical challenges has made me more conscious of how I handle data in my professional work. It has reinforced my commitment to following best practices when working with data, ensuring that I adhere to legal frameworks such as the GDPR.

#### Emotional Response and Learning

Throughout the module, I experienced a range of emotions, from excitement to critical reflection. I felt particularly proud of my ability to confidently handle the statistical worksheets and discussions, showcasing my mathematical abilities. This sense of accomplishment motivated me to engage even more deeply with the content, especially in collaborative discussions. Reading others' perspectives on topics like AI ethics helped shape my own views, and I found myself thinking more critically and holistically about these issues.

The discussions on ethics and AI governance had a profound impact on how I think about my work. I am now more aware of the potential biases and ethical dilemmas that could arise when using AI-driven technologies. This critical thinking has extended into my daily work, where I now evaluate not only the accuracy but also the fairness and ethical implications of the analysis I perform.

#### Personal and Professional Development

In addition to strengthening my research and statistical skills, this module has significantly improved my presentation skills. The process of creating and presenting my research proposal forced me to think carefully about how to communicate complex ideas clearly and persuasively. This skill is directly transferable to my current role as a data analyst, where clear communication of insights is crucial. I now feel more confident in delivering presentations, whether to colleagues or clients, and I am better equipped to explain the technical aspects of my work in an accessible way.

The skills I’ve developed in critical thinking, research methodology, and statistical analysis are invaluable tools that I will continue to use throughout my career. The ethical lessons from this module will also guide me in making responsible decisions when handling data or designing algorithms. I plan to apply these skills and insights to future projects, ensuring that I not only deliver results but also uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethical integrity.
