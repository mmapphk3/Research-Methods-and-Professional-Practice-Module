### Literature Review  

In my review of "Deep Learning for Recommender Systems: A Netflix Case Study" (Steck et al., 2021), I examined Netflix's shift from basic methods like collaborative filtering to deep learning models, which process larger datasets and capture more nuanced user behaviors. This shift improved personalization and prediction accuracy. However, the study highlights a gap between high-performing models in testing and their real-world impact on user satisfaction, underscoring the challenge of translating algorithmic gains into practical results. It also calls for more research into long-term user behavior and performance across cultural contexts to ensure recommendation systems remain efficient, equitable, and adaptable.

### Research Proposal 

My research proposal explores using clustering techniques to improve Spotify’s recommendation system by providing a more personalized user experience. Unlike traditional methods like collaborative filtering, which predicts preferences based on similar users, clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering will group users based on distinct listening patterns. This allows Spotify to offer more targeted recommendations and avoid irrelevant content.

Building on research by Sarwar et al. (2001) and Koren, Bell, and Volinsky (2009), which improved earlier models, the proposal addresses current system limitations in adapting to shifting user preferences and catering to niche genres. By applying clustering techniques, the goal is to better understand unique behaviors and improve user satisfaction.

The methodology involves collecting Spotify user data and applying clustering algorithms to identify patterns, followed by refining recommendation models and evaluating them using precision, recall, and retention metrics. Ethical considerations, including adherence to GDPR and addressing algorithmic bias, will ensure data privacy and representation of diverse music preferences.

The project aims to demonstrate that clustering can significantly enhance Spotify’s recommendation system, making it more adaptable and personalized to individual preferences in today’s dynamic digital environment.
