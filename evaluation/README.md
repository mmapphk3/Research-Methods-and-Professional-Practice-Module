### Literature Review

In my literature review on "Deep Learning for Recommender Systems: A Netflix Case Study" by Steck et al. (2021), I examined how Netflix uses advanced technology to suggest movies and shows to viewers. My goal was to understand and explain the research methods, findings, and the role of deep learning in making Netflix's suggestions more personalized. This review required me to dig deep into complex ideas and examine how Netflix's systems have evolved from using basic methods like collaborative filtering to more advanced deep learning models (Steck et al, 2021).

Throughout this review, I tackled several key points. For instance, I discussed how these advanced models use a wide range of data to better predict what users might like to watch. This is a step up from older methods that couldn't handle as complex user behavior patterns. I also looked at challenges like how these models perform in tests versus real life, which Steck et al. (2021) note as an issue because improvements in tests didn't always mean better user experiences. Addressing these mismatches was crucial for Netflix to refine their systems. Evaluating this study involved not just summarizing their findings but also critically thinking about their impact and what might still be missing, such as deeper studies into how these recommendations work over the long term or across different cultural contexts, which Manyika et al. (2019) suggest could reveal biases.

### Research Proposal

In my research proposal presentation, I discussed how clustering techniques could improve the way Spotify personalises music suggestions. The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that categorises Spotify users based on what they listen to, moving beyond the usual methods that predict preferences based on similar users' behaviors. This new approach aims to fix the issues with current systems by offering more customised music suggestions, which could enhance user involvement and satisfaction.

The project proposes a detailed collection and analysis of user data, using sophisticated methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering to pinpoint distinct patterns in listener behavior. This is backed by a thorough examination of previous research, which shows both the strengths and weaknesses of existing recommendation systems, referencing studies like those by Sarwar et al. (2001) and further insights into how adaptable machine learning models are when dealing with changing user preferences, as discussed by Koren, Bell, and Volinsky (2009).

The method will demand careful data management and statistical tests to verify the accuracy of the new model's recommendations. The expected results aim to show that using clustering to group users could significantly improve how relevant the music suggestions are, based on earlier research like Aggarwal et al. (2016). The metrics planned for use, such as precision and recall, would help measure how much better the personalised recommendations are compared to Spotify’s existing system.

Ethical handling of data and privacy is a critical part of the proposal, with a strict adherence to GDPR regulations and Spotify's own data-sharing rules. This focus on ethics is intended to ensure the research is conducted responsibly, addressing any potential biases and maintaining diversity in the recommendation system.

The proposal represented a deep dive into both existing knowledge and new research methods, involving complex legal and technical challenges. This effort not only aims to broaden my understanding of the issues at hand but also highlights the importance of ethical behavior in research involving data. By sticking to high ethical standards and focusing on technical goals, the project aims to greatly improve how recommendation systems work, making them more user-focused and advanced in the streaming industry.
