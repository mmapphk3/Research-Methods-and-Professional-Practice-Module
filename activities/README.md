### Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in computing in the age of Generative AI

Generative AI has reshaped industries since 2022, with rapid advancements like ChatGPT raising governance concerns (Hackningas, 2024). Correa et al. (2023) point out challenges in global AI regulation, as countries like China focus on state control, while the EU prioritizes privacy through regulations like the AI Act. Generative AI’s ability to create content autonomously raises issues around privacy, intellectual property, and misinformation, with inconsistent guidelines risking either over-regulation or misuse.

Deckard (2023) proposes a governance model combining global ethical rules with local adaptations, and Krishnan (2023) suggests regulatory sandboxes for safe AI experimentation. Legal questions over AI-generated content ownership (VP, 2023) and the rise of deepfakes (Kumar, 2023) erode public trust. Professionally, AI could automate jobs, requiring new skills like AI literacy. Global collaboration is crucial to establish ethical AI frameworks and address privacy and ownership concerns.

### Collab Discussion 1:

The malware disruption case study demonstrates how the ACM Code of Ethics applies when dealing with harmful software. The code tells computing professionals to put the public's well-being first, avoid causing harm, and maintain trust in the field. In this situation, professionals need to act responsibly to stop the malware, ensuring their actions are both ethical and legal.

According to the ACM Code, professionals must work to prevent further harm (ACM, 2018). For example, they should eliminate the malware without making things worse, like violating people's privacy or accessing systems without permission. The code also emphasizes the importance of professionals taking responsibility for their actions (ACM, 2018). This includes working with the right authorities and following legal rules when dealing with malware, especially since it often spreads across different countries. They need to understand and respect both local and international laws.

When comparing this with the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct, the BCS also highlights the need to protect the public interest and act with integrity (BCS, 2011). Both codes agree that professionals must cooperate with law enforcement and follow legal guidelines. In both cases, the role of professionalism is key, meaning that professionals must be honest, careful, and transparent in their actions to solve the problem without making things worse.

In conclusion, both the ACM and BCS codes guide professionals to handle incidents like malware responsibly. They must protect public trust, act lawfully, and make sure they do not cause additional harm while resolving the issue.

### Reflective Actvity 2

The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 is a prominent example of unethical data harvesting from Facebook users without proper consent. Cambridge Analytica accessed data through personality quizzes, not only gathering respondents’ data but also their friends’. This information was then used for targeted political campaigns, such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and Brexit (Confessore, 2018). The ethical breach lies in manipulating data collection under false pretenses, violating transparency and informed consent guidelines outlined in the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2019).

Legally, the scandal exposed weaknesses in data protection, prompting a $5 billion fine for Facebook and contributing to the enforcement of the EU's GDPR in 2018, which tightened regulations around data handling and consent (European Union, 2018). Socially, it damaged trust in social media and raised concerns about the role of big data in democracy, as users were unknowingly profiled for political ads (Confessore, 2018).

Other cases, such as health apps selling sensitive medical data or biased political polling, further stress the need for transparency and responsible data use. Legal measures like GDPR and ethical standards from professional bodies are crucial for safeguarding privacy and ensuring ethical survey practices.
