### Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in computing in the age of Generative AI

Generative AI has reshaped industries since 2022, with rapid advancements like ChatGPT raising governance concerns (Hackningas, 2024). Correa et al. (2023) point out challenges in global AI regulation, as countries like China focus on state control, while the EU prioritizes privacy through regulations like the AI Act. Generative AI’s ability to create content autonomously raises issues around privacy, intellectual property, and misinformation, with inconsistent guidelines risking either over-regulation or misuse.

Deckard (2023) proposes a governance model combining global ethical rules with local adaptations, and Krishnan (2023) suggests regulatory sandboxes for safe AI experimentation. Legal questions over AI-generated content ownership (VP, 2023) and the rise of deepfakes (Kumar, 2023) erode public trust. Professionally, AI could automate jobs, requiring new skills like AI literacy. Global collaboration is crucial to establish ethical AI frameworks and address privacy and ownership concerns.

### Collab Discussion 1:

The malware disruption case study underscores the relevance of the ACM Code of Ethics when managing harmful software. According to the code, computing professionals must prioritize the public's well-being, avoid causing harm, and maintain trust within the industry (ACM, 2018). In addressing malware, professionals are expected to act responsibly, ensuring their interventions do not exacerbate the situation. For example, they must remove malware without compromising privacy or illegally accessing systems. The code also emphasizes accountability, meaning professionals must take ownership of their actions and work within legal boundaries, which is crucial since malware often crosses international borders, requiring an understanding of both local and global laws.

Similarly, the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct highlights the importance of protecting public interest and acting with integrity (BCS, 2011). Both the ACM and BCS codes stress that professionals must cooperate with authorities and follow legal procedures when addressing malware. The role of professionalism is key in both frameworks, requiring professionals to act honestly, transparently, and with care to resolve the problem without creating further harm. Ultimately, both codes guide computing professionals to handle malware incidents ethically and lawfully, preserving public trust while mitigating risks.

### Reflective Activity 2

The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 is a prominent example of unethical data harvesting from Facebook users without proper consent. Cambridge Analytica accessed data through personality quizzes, not only gathering respondents’ data but also their friends’. This information was then used for targeted political campaigns, such as the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and Brexit (Confessore, 2018). The ethical breach lies in manipulating data collection under false pretenses, violating transparency and informed consent guidelines outlined in the ACM Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and the BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2019).

Legally, the scandal exposed weaknesses in data protection, prompting a $5 billion fine for Facebook and contributing to the enforcement of the EU's GDPR in 2018, which tightened regulations around data handling and consent (European Union, 2018). Socially, it damaged trust in social media and raised concerns about the role of big data in democracy, as users were unknowingly profiled for political ads (Confessore, 2018).

Other cases, such as health apps selling sensitive medical data or biased political polling, further stress the need for transparency and responsible data use. Legal measures like GDPR and ethical standards from professional bodies are crucial for safeguarding privacy and ensuring ethical survey practices.
